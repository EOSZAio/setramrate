# Telos setramrate

## Background

In order to avoid RAM market speculation at the launch of the Telos blockchain, a significant portion of the blockchain RAM was purchased by the ramlaunch.tf account. This RAM was gradually sold over the past 18 months to ensure a stable RAM price. This initial allocation of RAM has now been sold, necessitating the setting on the blockchain RAM rate to a non-zero rate. Up until September 1 when the final RAM from ramlaunch.tf was sold RAM was sold at a rate on 4096 bytes per minute. It is proposed that the chain RAM rate be set to 64 bytes per block (7Â 680 per minute). This multi-sig sets the RAM rate to 64 bytes per block.
